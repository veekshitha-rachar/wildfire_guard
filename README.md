# 🔥 WildFireGuard
### AI-Powered Wildfire Prediction & Emergency Response System

WildFireGuard is an AI-powered disaster preparedness and emergency response system designed to predict wildfire risks before ignition, detect distress signals in real time, and generate automated emergency alerts. The system combines Machine Learning, Flask APIs, and an interactive dashboard to enable proactive disaster management and faster emergency response.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Wildfires cause severe environmental damage, loss of biodiversity, and pose a significant threat to human life. Most existing systems detect fires only after ignition, resulting in delayed emergency response.

WildFireGuard addresses this challenge by combining **early wildfire prediction** with **real-time distress detection** and **automated alert generation** into a single intelligent platform.

## 🔮 Extending the System

1. **More training data**: Add Kaggle datasets to `data/` and update `data_pipeline.py`
2. **Real database**: Replace `ALERTS = {}` in `app.py` with SQLite / PostgreSQL
3. **SMS alerts**: Integrate Twilio API in the `/alert` route
4. **Image CNN**: Add MobileNet inference in `/image-predict` route
5. **Real-time map**: Embed Leaflet.js map in admin dashboard with live alert pins
6. **Push notifications**: Use Firebase FCM for mobile alerts
